# R code
The code in this repository was written while I was working on a variety of topics, some serious and work related, others just part of my love for pointless yet rewarding (for me) manipulation of data. Most, but not necessarily all, are used in my blog, [Daahtaah or Daytaah?](https://julien-arino.github.io/).

If you end up using any of the code here, I welcome (but do not require) an acknowledgement email (my contact info can be found on the blog).
